# AI Agent Prompt for App Replication

## ðŸŽ¯ **Recommended AI Agent Prompt**

```
You are tasked with replicating a professional web application using Next.js App Router. I have provided you with a comprehensive guide file called "AI_AGENT_REPLICATION_GUIDE.md" that contains detailed instructions, code examples, and implementation steps.

**Your Mission:**
1. Read and understand the AI_AGENT_REPLICATION_GUIDE.md file completely
2. Follow the 6-phase implementation plan exactly as specified
3. Implement all visual design elements to achieve 100% parity with the reference application
4. Ensure all functional features work identically to the original

**Critical Requirements:**
- Start with Phase 1 (CSS Variables & Theme System) - this is the foundation
- Implement the elevation system early - it's what makes the app look professional
- Use Space Grotesk font family - it's a key visual differentiator
- Add hover-elevate classes to ALL interactive elements
- Match the exact color scheme, border radius values, and spacing

**Reference Application:** https://cosplay-shoot-manager.onrender.com
**Target Technology:** Next.js App Router with Supabase backend

**Success Criteria:**
- Visual screenshots should be indistinguishable from the reference app
- All functionality must work identically
- Smooth interactions and professional polish
- Complete feature parity across all pages

**Important Notes:**
- The guide contains specific code examples - use them exactly
- Focus on empty states - they're crucial for user guidance
- Test with real data when possible
- The reference app is exceptionally well-designed - replicate it precisely

**Files to Focus On:**
- app/globals.css (CSS variables and elevation system)
- tailwind.config.ts (font families and border radius)
- All component files (add hover-elevate classes)
- Page components (implement exact layouts)

Follow the guide step-by-step, implement each phase completely before moving to the next, and ensure every detail matches the reference application. The guide contains everything you need - just follow it precisely.

## Critical Missing Features

### 1. File Upload System (High Priority)
**Impact**: Users cannot upload reference images or shoot photos
**Required Implementation**:
- Supabase Storage integration
- File upload API endpoints
- Image processing and optimization
- File type validation and security

### 2. Resource Management (High Priority)
**Impact**: Users cannot manage equipment, personnel, costumes, or locations
**Required Implementation**:
- Complete CRUD operations for all resource types
- Database schema updates
- API route implementations
- Frontend components

### 3. Google Calendar Integration (Medium Priority)
**Impact**: Users cannot sync shoots with their calendar
**Required Implementation**:

## Technical Debt and Improvements

### Database Schema
- **Issue**: Some resource tables may not exist in Supabase
- **Solution**: Run database migrations to ensure all tables are created

### API Consistency
- **Issue**: Some API routes have different response formats
- **Solution**: Standardize API responses across all endpoints

### Error Handling
- **Issue**: Inconsistent error handling across API routes
- **Solution**: Implement comprehensive error handling middleware

### Testing
- **Issue**: Limited test coverage for new API routes
- **Solution**: Add comprehensive test suites for all API endpoints

## Performance Considerations

### Old App Performance
- **Pros**: Full Express server with persistent connections
- **Cons**: Single server instance, potential bottlenecks

### New App Performance
- **Pros**: Serverless functions, automatic scaling
- **Cons**: Cold start latency, function execution limits

## Security Considerations

### Authentication
- **Old**: Session-based with cookies
- **New**: JWT tokens (more stateless, better for serverless)

### File Upload Security
- **Missing**: File type validation, size limits, virus scanning
- **Required**: Implement comprehensive security measures

## Conclusion

The Next.js migration has successfully migrated core functionality but is missing several advanced features that users depend on. The most critical missing features are:

1. **File upload system** - Essential for reference images
2. **Resource management** - Core functionality for shoot planning
3. **Google integrations** - Important for workflow integration
4. **Email notifications** - Important for team collaboration

**Recommendation**: Focus on Phase 1 features first, as they are essential for basic functionality. The Google integrations and email features can be added in subsequent phases.

**Estimated Timeline**: 4-6 weeks to complete all missing features with proper testing and documentation.

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Implement resource management APIs and file upload system
2. **Short-term**: Add Google Calendar and Docs integration
3. **Medium-term**: Implement email notifications and advanced UI features
4. **Long-term**: Performance optimization and additional features

This migration represents a significant architectural improvement but requires completion of the missing features to achieve feature parity with the original application.
